\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to document the test specifications for the House in Your Head Project. This is written for test engineers so that they know which tests to perform to make sure the system is functioning properly. This section is the introduction. The following sections lay out Functional Tests, Usability Tests, Performance Tests, and Compliance Tests.

\subsection{References}

\section{Usability Testing}
%Describe the usability test you plan to perform at each phase of you system development to access the usability of the system, including both tests with and without users involved.]
\subsection{Tasks}

Several of the tests in this section refer to a series of tasks to be
completed by a tester. Unless otherwise specified, this series of tasks shall
include the following:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Calibrate for user
	\item Turn lights on and off
	\item Turn television on, change channel, change volume, turn off.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Development/Prototyping Phase}
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Phases & Prototyping/Development, Testing, Final \\ \hline
	Requirement & Software Functionality \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & A number of testers are selected and briefed on the
	system. This briefing includes intended use, target users, and basic
	system functionality. The tester then completes a series of tasks using
	out system while speaking their thought process out loud. The team member
	monitoring the test takes notes and asks the user for more feedback when
	necessary. It is important that the team member does not interfere or help
	the tester in completing their tasks. The goal of this test is to ensure
	that the system is intuitive for the user to use on a basic level and that
	the system behaves in an expected manner.
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Testing Phase}
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Phases & Testing, Final \\ \hline
	Requirement & Aesthetic Usability \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & A tester is briefed on the system. This briefing includes
	intended use, target users, and basic system functionality. The tester
	than completes a series of simple tasks throughout the entire system. The
	team member monitoring the test asks the tester for feedback in regards to
	the system's aesthetics. This test ensures that the components of the
	system are readable and are clear and easy to understand. This test should
	be done in the latter stages of the testing phase or in the final phase.
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Phases & Testing, Final \\ \hline
	Requirement & Error Prevention and Recovery \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & The tester is given a set of tasks to complete that
	intentionally cause errors. Once the error occurs, the team member will
	look for feedback from the tester on how they would intuitively recover
	from the error shown. After the error-inducing task is complete, the team
	member asks the tester what they think caused the error to be shown and
	what could they do in the future to prevent it. This test can be completed
	during any phase, but should be more heavily focused on during the testing
	phase. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Final Phase}
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Phases & Prototyping/Development, Testing, Final \\ \hline
	Requirement & General Usability \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & A tester is briefed on the system. This briefing includes
	intended use, target users, and basic system functionality. A team member
	monitoring the test asks the tester to complete a series of tasks using
	the system. As the tester moves through each step to complete the task,
	they are asked to vocally expresses their thought process and express
	anything that they think is unclear or have an issue with. This can
	include confusing system behavior, unclear user interface design,
	counterintuitive design, missing functionality, ease of use, or anything
	else the user feels would improve the usability of the system. This test
	can be completed at any phase of the development process in order to catch
	any usability issues early. However, there should be a large focus on this
	test towards the final phase when the system is nearing release. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Phases & Final \\ \hline
	Requirement & Consistency and Standards \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & A tester is briefed on the system. This briefing includes
	intended use, target users, and basic system functionality. A team member
	monitoring the test asks the tester to complete a series of tasks using
	the system. As the tester moves through each step to complete the task,
	the team member looks for feedback regarding the consistency of the
	system. This includes design consistency as well as consistency in
	functionality. This test also covers general system standards. This means
	ensuring the layout, functionality, and design follow the standards set
	for similar user applications. This test can be completed earlier, but
	should be included in the final phase.  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Phases & Final \\ \hline
	Requirement & Documentation \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & A tester is not briefed on the system and asked to read
	and review the documentation on the system. The team member distributing
	the test looks for feedback regarding the documentation itself. This
	includes factors such as clarity, completeness, and overall usefulness.
	Then, once the tester feels they are comfortable enough with the
	documentation, they are asked to complete a series of tasks. This test
	ensures that the documentation is clear, concise, and helpful to the user.
	This test should be done in the final phase near the release when all the
	documentation is complete. \\ \hline

\section{Performance Testing}
%[In the SRS, if there is any specified performance requirements in Section 3.3, you need to describe the performance requirement and how you plan to test if such requirement is satisfied.]
%Can use multiples subsections if need be
\subsection{SR305}

    \hline
	Requirement & The system must use less than 512 MB of RAM at all times while running. \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & Start the system on a machine meeting the minimum system
	requirements. Monitor the memory usage of the program during the
	following:
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item User calibration
	    \item Menu selection and automated home response
	    \item Idle time
	\end{enumerate}
	Verify that memory usage remains below 512 MB. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\subsection{SR310}
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Requirement & The system must use less than 5 GB of persistent storage
	space when installed. \\ \hline

\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Requirement & The system must run smoothly on a 3.2 GHz Intel i3 processor. \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & Install the system on a machine with these specifications
	and meeting the other minimum system requirements. Perform the following
	tasks and verify that it runs smoothly (i.e. without stuttering or
	becoming unresponsive):
	\begin{enumerate}
	    \item User calibration
	    \item Menu selection and automated home response
	    \item Idle time
	\end{enumerate}
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\subsection{SR320}
%CHECK THIS.
%Not sure if the following 2 are necessary
% FIXME Should probably have something down, even if it's trivial like this.
% Is this OK?
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Requirement & The system will support one and only one terminal. \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & Launch the program. Verify that it runs on one machine. \\ \hline

\subsection{SR330}
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
    % XXX Come to think of it, this one is hard to verify since it depends on
    % a "trained user."
    % XXX What kind of menu selections?
	Requirement & 90\% of time, menu selection must take less than 5 seconds. \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & Time a trained user making a sequence of at least 20 menu selections. Verify that at least 90\% of the selections are made correctly in less than 5 seconds. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\subsection{SR335}
\begin{tabular}{| l | p{12cm}  |}
    \hline
	Requirement & A trained user must be able to select 10 options within 2 minutes. \\ \hline
	Test Procedure & Time a trained user making a sequence of 10 menu selections. Verify that this takes under 2 minutes. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\newpage

\section{Compliance Testing}
%[If the system must comply with certain functional or technical standards, describe the aspects of the standard that must be complied here and how you plan to test such compliance.]
% NOTE: We dont have standards with insteon i think. Just write stuff about testing the API we wrap theirs with?

There are no functional or technical standards with which the system must
comply.
