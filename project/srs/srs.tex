\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to describe the requirements of the House in
Your Head system. The remaining sections define the scope of the project,
introduce necessary language and definitions, give an overview of the project,
and lay out the requirements for the system.

\subsection{Scope}

This system is intended as a way for users to make basic state changes in an
Insteon automated home setting using a Brain Computer Interface. Basic states
to be changed are characterized by binary (on/off) or integer settings---for
example, a lamp, or a television's channel setting. The system's user
interface is controlled by binary actions. Complex systems with multiple or
intermediate states are out of the scope of the Brain Computer Interface
portion of this project. Some settings that have multiple states can be
maintained by an administrator. This administrator will need to do so via a
mouse and keyboard.

The system interfaces with Insteon home automation devices. It sends signals
to the Insteon controller that then relay the messages to the appropriate part
of the smart house. The Insteon devices themselves are not considered part of
the system, but are required external components, and the system interfaces
with them specifically.

The initial version of the system uses only the Dimmer and IR Transmitter
modules. The former allows the system to control dimmable lamps and any device
that only needs to be powered; the latter covers televisions, stereos, and any
other device that has an IR remote control. The code base is to be organized
in such a way that it is simple for support for additional Insteon modules to
be added.

The potential users of this system will be people who suffer from ALS, as well
as the administrators who will be assisting the general users set up the
program and software. Dr. Sara Feldman, The ALS Center of Hope at Drexel
University, and Professor Jeff Salvage are the primary stakeholders and
sponsors of this project.

\newpage

\section{Overall Description}

\subsection{Product Perspective}

\subsubsection{System Interface}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ContextDiagram.png}
\caption{Context Diagram of the system}
\label{fig:contextdia}
\end{figure}

The user wears an Emotiv headset, which sends information about their thoughts
to the connected computer. A graphical interface prompts the user to make
selections via their thoughts, and the resulting EEG information is
interpreted as commands to be sent to the home automation controller. The
controller in turn sends commands to the Insteon system to command the
connected components, such as the television and lights.

\subsubsection{User Interface}

The user interface consists of the Emotiv device and a graphical user
interface to be shown on a standard computer display. The Emotiv device is
attached to the user's head and calibrated to read their brain's electrical
impulses, which are generated in response to prompts from the display. These
impulses are then converted into commands that are then used as input. The
exact input will be one of two states: neutral or active. Because there are
only two states for the input, the complexity of the user interface as a whole
is intentionally limited. This will allow for a simpler user experience and
easy usability. The commands sent to the HAS are based on what is shown on the
screen when the user selects.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

The system interfaces with both the Emotiv Epoc device and the Insteon
PowerLinc Modem via Universal Serial Bus (USB). The PowerLinc Modem then
communicates with other Insteon devices. Both are required external
components.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

The Emotiv framework provides a set of functions which allows access to the
EEG data. The system communicates with the Insteon PowerLinc Modem via a
serial port.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}

The system communicates with components of the Insteon system via its USB
connection to the PowerLinc Modem, using the Insteon-defined command set.

\subsubsection{Memory Constraints}

The system runs on consumer systems, so its RAM footprint must be limited
accordingly.

\subsubsection{Operations}

The system has two modes of operation: calibration and active. Calibration
consists of having the Patient (as described in section \ref{sec:UserChar})
train the system to associate certain brainwaves with actions.

Active mode occurs after calibration has finished. In this mode, the user
manipulates the state of their house via the system.

\subsubsection{Site Adaption Requirements}

The system must run in both a home and a healthcare setup, as long as an
Insteon system consisting of supported home control devices is present. No
modifications to the system, other than configuration for available devices,
are required to change between these two environments.

However, it is expected that not all types of Insteon devices will be
supported in the initial release, and more will be developed over time. It
must be possible for a competent developer to add support for a new device
without undue modification to the rest of the system.

\subsection{Product Functions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Gather EEG data from the user
\item Analyse and filter the EEG data to make a reliable signal
\item Provide user with a menu from which to select home automation actions
\item Perform selected home automation actions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\label{sec:UserChar}
Two categories of users are considered:

\begin{description}
    \item[Patients] are those suffering from ALS who are the primary users of
        the system. The severity of the disorder in each patient can range
        from limited mobility to full paralysis; the system assumes the
        latter.
    \item[Caretakers] are individuals not suffering from ALS who are
        responsible for Patients. They are assumed to be present during system
        setup and administrative tasks, but \textbf{not} during other use
        cases.
    \item[Device Support Developers] are those who wish to add support for an
        unsupported Insteon device, or a custom device that conforms to the
        Insteon standards. They are assumed to have some programming
        experience and knowledge of the target device, but not necessarily
        familiarity with this system.

\end{description}

\subsection{Constraints}

One of the most immediately obvious constraints on the entire system is the
user's muscular degeneration. This limitation is the inspiration for the
system and the prime motivator for this project and must be kept in mind at
all times.

Another constraint is the average user's familiarity with computer systems. An
interface that may work well for an experienced programmer may not work well
for an inexperienced computer user. Designing for the inexperienced user is
necessary.

A final issue is that users may have other medical issues that need to be
kept in mind. Those that occur with ALS are most important, such as vision
issues. A common visual impairment for those with ALS is color blindness,
which must be accounted for when designing the user interface, as the
primary feedback from our system to the user is visual. A user that cannot
distinguish between different shades may be completely unable to use key
features of the system. For example, if button toggles are set up as a
red-green selector, then a red-green colorblind user will be unable to use
those toggles.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}

There are many assumptions contained in the design of the system. First and
foremost is that users must have the ability to read and write English.
While the system can later be adapted to other languages, being unable to
interact with a user interface in English will make the system impossible to
work with.

The Emotiv requires a large amount of concentration, so any user needs to be
able to concentrate to effectively use it. If a user cannot concentrate,
their commands will not be recognized by the program.

A user of the system is assumed to be able to see or hear options in the
program. A user that is unable to see or hear will have no other methods of
interfacing with the program, making it unusable.

Users of the system must have access to all of the equipment required to
power a computer, as well as reliable electricity service. Without this, the
device and the computer it interfaces with will not work.

Additionally, the computer that the user owns must meet the minimum system
requirements. Without this assumption, the program may behave unpredictably.

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}

During the first term, we will focus on getting a reliable signal from the EEG
and developing the initial ideas for our user interfaces. For the second term,
we will mostly finish those two tasks and begin working on the home automation
portion of the project. The final term will consist of finishing the
integration with the home automation portion and resolving any remaining
issues.

\newpage

\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{External Interfaces}

This section gives a description of the hardware and software interfaces. Also included is a basic prototype of the UI.

\subsubsection{System Interfaces}

\textbf{SR105} The system will accept input from the Emotiv device and
distinguish at least two thought-states of the patient.

\textbf{SR110} The system will interface with the Insteon system to turn
lights on and off upon user request.

\textbf{SR115} The system will interface with the Insteon system to turn a
television on and off upon user request.

\textbf{SR116} The system will interface with the Insteon system to change a
television's channel upon user request.

\textbf{SR117} The system will interface with the Insteon system to change a
television's volume upon user request.

See \autoref{fig:contextdia} for a context diagram of the system.


\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

\textbf{SR205} The screen will prompt the user to calibrate the Emotiv device and display the result of the calibration.

\textbf{SR210} The screen will contain some text and an optional image relating to the text.

\textbf{SR215} If the user selects on a screen, the current choice is selected and the next screen shows up. 

\textbf{SR220} If the user does not select on a screen, the next option will appear after 2 seconds of inactivity. 

\textbf{SR225} After 2 complete cycles, the previous scrolling UI will appear.


See \autoref{fig:config}, \autoref{fig:mockup}, and \autoref{fig:integer} for UI mock-ups.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ConfigurationUI.png}
	\caption{
	    Mock-up of calibration procedure. To calibrate the Emotiv device, the
	    user is prompted to think a strong accept thought. The yellow screen
	    represents the system while it is still calibration, while the green
	    screen represents calibration success. The red screen represents an
	    error in the calibration (e.g. timeout or device error).
	}
	\label{fig:config}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ApplicationUI.png}
    \caption{
        Mock-up of main HAS device action selection. From the idle state, the
        user thinks the calibrated accept thought to begin menu selection. The
        system cycles through available devices, and chooses the current
        device when the accepted thought is selected. An action for that
        device is selected in the same way. If additional input (e.g. integer
        input) is required, it is accepted in an appropriate way (see
        \autoref{fig:integer} for an example). Finally, the action is
        performed and the system returns to the idle state.
    }
    \label{fig:mockup}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{IntegerInput.png}
    \caption{
        Mock-up of integer input interface. The user selects each digit as the
        interface auto-scrolls through digits, in a similar way to device and
        action selection. The user can also end digit selection early if the
        intended number has fewer than the maximum possible number of digits.
        After several cycles, the interface will time out and return to the
        previous digit or to the previous menu component (not shown).
