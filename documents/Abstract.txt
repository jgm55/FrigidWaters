Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease. The motor neurons progressively degenerate and die off, leading to the loss of muscle control. Patients eventually become totally paralyzed. In this state, the patient is aware but cannot move their body in any way. Because of this, late-stage ALS patients are unable to interface with conventional assistive technologies. Our goal is to build a system which people afflicted with ALS can use to interact with their houses through Home Automation Systems (HAS). This includes controlling the thermostat, lights, stereo, and television. By having a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) to their automated house, individuals with ALS can still interact with their environment despite full paralysis. This builds off of a previous senior design project. The interface will be improved, and methods of input training and processing will be experimented with using the Emotiv device.
